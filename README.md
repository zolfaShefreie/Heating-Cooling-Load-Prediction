# Heating & Cooling Load Prediction
use machine learning classifiers for predict heating and cooling load in Energy Efficiency dataset.<br/>
## Heading load
in this project heating load is discretizated and is divided into two categories (less than 18, greater than 18) and is used as label for predict category of new data. the classifiers that are used:
- decision tree
- random forest
## cooling load
it is divided into 5 categories and is used as label in classification problem. the classifiers:
- SVC
- neural network
